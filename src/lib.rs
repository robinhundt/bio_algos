//! This crate contains algorithms and datastructures for the fulfillment of the
//! the first assignment of the w*ourse at the
//! university of GÃ¶ttingen.  
//! The crate is divided this base module, an analysis module and a util module.  
//! In the base module some types and methods on them have been implemented (Base, Startcodon, Sequence).
//! The Analysis module contains an implementation of a position weight matrix, as well as
//! methods that can be used to evaluate a pwm on aligned sequences.  
//! The util module contains some utility functions for reading sequence data from a file.
